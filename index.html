      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a critical threat to
        classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC, particularly in
        Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where secure communication is
        essential but often constrained by limited computational resources. This
        paper investigates the feasibility of deploying post-quantum
        cryptography (PQC) algorithms on resource-constrained devices. In
        particular, we implement three PQC algorithms --- BIKE, CRYSTALS-Kyber,
        and HQC --- on a lightweight IoT platform built with Raspberry Pi
        devices. Leveraging the Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) library in
        conjunction with mbedTLS, we develop quantum-secure key exchange
        protocols, and evaluate their performance in terms of computational
        overhead, memory usage, and energy consumption for quantum secure
        communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of
        PQC algorithms on constrained hardware is practical, reinforcing the
        urgent need for quantum-resilient cryptographic frameworks in
        next-generation IoT devices.

      <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In today’s world, millions—if not billions—of people use a wide variety
        of devices. This ranges from the typical gadgets like phones, laptops,
        and computers to more specialized smart appliances such as electric
        toothbrushes and smart cat litter trays. These devices are categorized
        as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and are equipped with
        microcontrollers, transceivers for digital communications, and suitable
        protocol stacks that enable them to communicate with one another and
        with users. IoT devices are constantly evolving, with the goal of
        connecting everyday objects to the Internet. This allows them to
        collect, share, and analyze data much easier, improving efficiency,
        productivity, and convenience. While the concept of integrating everyday
        devices with the Internet through IoT is promising, significant
        vulnerabilities remain that have not been thoroughly addressed.

      <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
      <p>This study evaluates the performance of three post-quantum key
      encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) -- BIKE, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and HQC, within a
      simulated client-server communication framework. The goal is to assess the
      feasibility of deploying these algorithms on constrained embedded systems
      by measuring their power consumption, execution time, memory usage, and
      communication throughput.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-block: 15px">Experimental Setup</h3>
          <p>
            The experimental setup, shown in the diagram, consisted of a
            Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as the client and a Raspberry Pi 5 as the
            server. Both devices ran Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a Debian-based system
            selected for its minimal overhead and lightweight design. An offline
            network switch connected the two devices, providing an isolated
            environment free from external interference to ensure consistent and
            reproducible measurements.

            A custom lightweight protocol is implemented for benchmarking consiting of the following steps:

          <h3 style="margin-block: 15px">Performance Evaluation Procedure</h3>
          <p>
            To evaluate the performance of each algorithm, the client and server applications are executed concurrently in isolated sessions. Four text files of varying sizes (208 bytes, 731 bytes, 1235 bytes, and 2328 bytes) are used to simulate different communication loads and observe the impact of message size on system performance. The use of text files were chosen for their simplicity and transparency, allowing us to easily control the data size, format, and structure. This approach is straightforward for manual testing, reproducibility and consistency. Each session runs for a fixed duration of five minutes, followed by a five-minute rest period to allow the devices to return to baseline thermal and performance conditions.

      <p>
        All software is developed in C, using mbedTLS (version 3.6) as the
        primary cryptographic library, extended with liboqs from the Open
        Quantum Safe (OQS) project (version 0.12). Each KEM is integrated
        independently into the communication protocol to allow for a fair
        evaluation.
